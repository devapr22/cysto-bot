## 📌 Project Overview  
**CystoBot** is a simple, interactive web-based chatbot designed to raise awareness about PCOS/PCOD and guide users with basic symptom assessment, lifestyle tips, and suggestions. The chatbot asks users a series of questions, provides corresponding remedies, and offers diet and exercise recommendations based on user input.

## 🧠 Problem Statement  
PCOS and PCOD are often underdiagnosed due to lack of awareness, especially among young women. Our aim was to create a beginner-friendly chatbot that makes this information more accessible in a conversational way.

## 💡 Key Features  
- Interactive symptom-based questionnaire  
- Instant remedy suggestions based on responses  
- Diet and exercise tips for managing PCOS  
- Simple animations and visual enhancements  
- Mobile-friendly design

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
| Purpose        | Tools / Languages         |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Frontend       | HTML, CSS, JavaScript     |
| Deployment     | Vercel                    |
| IDE/Testing    | Visual Studio Code, Chrome |

> ⚠️ **Note:** This version is frontend-only. During the original hackathon, the project also included a backend using Python (Flask), but due to mentor-led deployment and file loss, the backend code is currently unavailable. We are in the process of learning Flask independently to recreate it.

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Open the folder in a code editor (like VS Code)  
3. Run the `index.html` file in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

No setup is required — this is a static project.
